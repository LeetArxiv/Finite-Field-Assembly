## What's this?
**Finite Field Assembly (FF-ASM)** is a programming language **designed to emulate GPUs on regular CPUs using** Pure Mathematics. 

The project's goal is to democratize AI compute such that the systems of the future are neither controlled by rich countries nor big tech. 

We build on Finite Field theory, a branch of mathematics I studied at Yale University. 
The main idea is to use the _properties of prime numbers to multiply several array elements at the same time_. 
It's **like GPU hardware parallelization but we replace the GPU kernels with prime numbers**.

Our work is centered around these meticulously-researched topics in Number theory and Finite Field theory : 
- The divisibilty properties of primes.
- The theory of linear congruences.
- Redundant residue number systems.
- The Chinese Remainder Theorem.

Finite Field Assembly merely applies these obscure topics in mathematics to a mainstream problem - making AI compute available to everyone.

We have paying users supporting our Substack.  
It's blazingly fast and compiles to C.

✔ **Finite Field is the primary data structure** : FF-asm is a CUDA alternative designed for computations over finite fields.

✔ **Recursive computing support** : not cache-aware vectorization, not parallelization, but performing a calculation inside a calculation inside another calculation.

✔ **Extension of C89** - runs everywhere gcc is available.
